# seven-west-coding-challenge

To run the app:
- Download the repository to your local machine.
- Open up a console/terminal and navigate directory the repo was downloaded into.
- Run 'npm install'. this may take several minutes.
- Run 'npm run start' to start the server and open the browser. If Windows complains about the firewall just click allow access.
- You should see the app open in the browser.

A few notes:
- You'll need to have npm installed (I'm running version 5.6)
- I've only run the app in Chrome, so I can't guarantee that it will work in other browsers.
